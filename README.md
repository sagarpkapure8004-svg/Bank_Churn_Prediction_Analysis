# Bank_Churn_Prediction_Analysis
Project Overview
This project identifies the key drivers of customer attrition for a retail bank using a multi-model machine learning approach. By analyzing 14 behavioral and demographic features, we developed a predictive system to help the bank proactively retain high-risk customers.
Key Features (14 Input Columns)
The analysis utilizes a mix of raw and engineered features to capture complex churn patterns:
Demographics: Scaled Age, Gender, and Geography (France/Spain/Germany).
Bank Relationship: Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, and IsActiveMember.
Financial Metrics: Estimated Salary and Credit Score.
Engineered Features: Engagement Score, Balance-to-Salary Ratio, and Product-to-Tenure Ratio.

Model Explainability & Business Insights
Using SHAP Value Analysis and Feature Importance Ranking, we identified the following critical drivers of churn:
NumOfProducts: Customers with 3 or more products show a significantly higher probability of churn.
Engagement Score: Our custom engineered feature was a top-three predictor, proving that behavioral activity is more telling than simple demographics.
Scaled Age: Older customers (specifically in the 45-60 age bracket) represent a higher attrition risk.
Strategic Recommendations
Targeted Retention: The bank should prioritize "High-Risk" alerts generated by the Random Forest model, focusing on inactive, high-balance members.
Product Optimization: Relationship managers should intervene when customers reach the "3-Product" threshold to ensure service satisfaction
